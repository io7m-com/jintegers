## jintegers

The `jintegers` package provides basic functions to pack and unpack integers
to/from byte arrays in specific byte orders.

## Status

As the Java platform evolves, libraries that may have been necessary in the
past can become unnecessary due to new platform features. The `jintegers`
package falls into this category: The new
[Foreign Function And Memory API](https://openjdk.org/jeps/424) makes much
of the functionality here redundant.

This package is in maintenance mode and will not see any new functionality.

## Features

* High coverage test suite.
* Written in pure Java 17.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/)
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)
* ISC license.

## Usage

```
byte data[] = new byte[4];

Signed32.packToBytesLittleEndian(23, data);

int r = Signed32.unpackFromBytesLittleEndian(data);
```
